# Performance Reviews

An overview of the quarterly review process is in [The
Playbook][playbook-reviews].

As part of the quarterly review we collect feedback from the people you've
worked with in the last quarter, ensure it is anonymous, and share it with you.
We also ask you similar questions about yourself.

These are the questions we ask:
